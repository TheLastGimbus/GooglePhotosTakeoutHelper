## 3.4.3

### Just a few patches ❤️‍🩹

- put stuff in `date-unknown` also when not div-to-dates - #245
- fix extras detection on mac - #243
- add note to not worry about album finding ;)
- nice message when trying to run interactive on headless

## 3.4.2

### Bug fixes again 🐛

- (maybe?) fix weird windoza trailing spaces in folder names (literally wtf??) - #212
  
  Not sure about this one so hope there will be no day-1 patch 😇🙏

- update to Dart 3 🔥
- recognize `.mts` files as videos, unlike Apache 😒 - #223
- change shortcuts/symlinks to relative so it doesn't break on folder move 🤦 - #232
- don't fail on set-file-modification errors - turns out there are lot of these - #229

### Happy takeouts 👽

## 3.4.1

- Lot of serious bug fixes
  - Interactive unzipping was disabled because it sometimes lost *a lot of* photos ;_;
    
    Sorry if anyone lost anything - now I made some visual instruction on how to unzip
  - Gracefully handle powershell fail - it fails with non-ascii names :(
- Great improvement on json matching - now, my 5k Takeout has 100% matches!

## 3.4.0

### Albums 🎉

It finally happened everyone! It wasn't easy, but I think I nailed it and everything should perfectly 👌

You get **_🔥FOUR🔥_** different options on how you want your albums 😱 - detailed descriptions about them is at: https://github.com/TheLastGimbus/GooglePhotosTakeoutHelper/discussions/187#discussion-4980576

(This also automatically nicely covers Trash/Archive, so previous solution that originally closed the https://github.com/TheLastGimbus/GooglePhotosTakeoutHelper/issues/138 was replaced)

### Happy Take-outing 🥳 

## 3.3.5

- Address #178 issues in logs - instructions on what to do

  Sorry but this is all i can do for now :( we may get actual fix if https://github.com/brendan-duncan/archive/pull/244 ever moves further

## 3.3.4

- New name-guess patterns from @matt-boris <3
- Support 19**-s and 18**-s while name guessing
  > First camera was invented in 1839. I don't underestimate you guys anymore :eyes:
- Fix path errors on windoza while unzipping #172
- Fix #175 bad guessing json files with `...(1)` stuff

## 3.3.3

- Fix memory crashes :D
- nicer names for split-to-dates thanks to @denouche #168 <3

## 3.3.2

- Bump SDK and dependencies

## 3.3.1

### Fix bugs introduced in `v3.3.0` 🤓

- #147 Support `.tgz` files too
- #145 **DON'T** use ram memory equal to zip file thanks to `asyncWrite: true` flag 🙃
- #143 don't crash when encoding is other than `utf8` 🍰
- #136 #144 - On windzoa, set time to 1970 if it's before that - would love to *actually* fix this, but Dart doesn't let me :/

## 3.3.0

- Fix #143 - issues when encoding is not utf8 - sadly, others are still not supported, just skipped
- Ask for divide-to-folders in interactive
- Close #138 - support Archive/Trash folders!

  Implementation of this is a bit complicated, so may break, but should work 99% times
- Fix #134 - nicely tell user what to do when no "year folders" instead of exceptions
- Fix #92 - Much better json finding!
  
  It now should find all of those `...-edited(1).jpg.json` - this also makes it faster because it rarely falls back to reading exif, which is slower
- More small fixes and refactors

### Enjoy even faster and more stable `gpth` everyone 🥳🥳🥳

## 3.2.0

- Brand new ✨interactive mode✨ - just double click 🤘
  - `gpth` now uses 💅discontinued💅 [`file_picker_desktop`](https://pub.dev/packages/file_picker_desktop) to launch pickers for user to select output folder and input...
  - ...zips 🤐! because it also decompresses the takeouts for you! (People had ton of trouble of how to join them etc - no worries anymore!)
- Donation link
